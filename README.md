# 30 Days of JavaScript Projects

The primary inspiration for this repository is the [30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/641a0d838adc636a0b62aecc) by Wes Bos. The main idea is to practice JavaScript daily for 30 days by creating small projects.


## Project Structure

Each project will have its own folder. Inside each folder, you will find an `index.html` file, a `style.css` file, and a `script.js` file.

The `index.html` file contains the HTML markup for the project. The `style.css` file contains the CSS styles for the project, and the `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code for the project.
